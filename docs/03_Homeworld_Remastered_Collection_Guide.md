This section of The Homeworld Legacy Archives covers the Homeworld Remastered Collection (2015) by Gearbox Software.

### A. Getting the Game

*   **Platforms:** [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244160/Homeworld_Remastered_Collection/), [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/homeworld_remastered_collection).
*   **Contents:**
    *   Homeworld Remastered (HW1 campaign rebuilt in HW2 engine, with new UI, graphics)
    *   Homeworld 2 Remastered (Updated HW2 engine, new UI, graphics)
    *   Homeworld Classic (Original HW1 v1.05, adapted for modern OS)
    *   Homeworld 2 Classic (Original HW2 v1.1, adapted for modern OS)
    *   Multiplayer Beta access (merged HW1 & HW2 races).

### B. Running on Modern Systems & Troubleshooting

*   **General Stability:** HWR is designed for modern systems but can still have issues.
*   **Launcher Crash Fix (Original Launcher Issues):**
    *   **Fix (from initial data):** [GitHub - lone-wolf-akela/HWR_Launcher_CrashFix](https://github.com/lone-wolf-akela/HWR_Launcher_CrashFix/) - For old launcher issues with auth site 404s. The launcher has since been updated by Gearbox.
*   **Common Issues & Fixes:**
    *   **Black Screen/Crashes:** Update graphics drivers, ensure DirectX is up to date, run as administrator.
    *   **Performance:** Adjust in-game graphics settings. Some mods can heavily impact performance.
    *   **Multiplayer Desyncs:** Were prevalent early on; patches have improved this. Ensure all players have the same game version and mods.
*   **Classic Versions in HWR - Important Notes:**
    *   **HW1 Classic:** While based on v1.05, it runs through a Gearbox compatibility layer. Some subtle engine behaviors, rendering, and especially `.BIG` file format might differ from the 1999 original. This can affect compatibility with very old mods or tools expecting the exact 1999 file structure.
    *   **HW2 Classic:** Similar to HW1 Classic, adapted for modern OS.
    *   **Mod Compatibility with Classics:** Generally better for HW1 Classic mods than HWR. However, mods heavily reliant on specific engine quirks or file formats of the original 1999/2003 releases might still have issues.

### C. Mods & Modding (HWR specific)

*   **Platform:** Primarily [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/workshop/). GOG users can use tools to download Steam Workshop mods.
*   **Notable HWR Mods (See [ModDB HWR Mods](https://www.moddb.com/games/homeworld-remastered-collection/mods) and Steam Workshop):**
    *   **Homeworld Remastered Players Patch (Community Patch):** A significant community effort to fix bugs, improve balance, and enhance features beyond official patches. Highly recommended.
    *   **Complex Mod (HWR):** A massive overhaul mod adding new units, factions, and mechanics.
    *   **FX:Galaxy Mod (formerly Homeworld Universe Mod):** Focuses on graphical enhancements, new ship models, and expanded gameplay.
