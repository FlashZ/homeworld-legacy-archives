### B. Homeworld 1 & Cataclysm Specific Tools

*   **Map Editors & Utilities:**
    *   **Missionman:** The original map editor. *Original download is elusive; often bundled in old modding packs. The example files from initial data (`mission.mdr`, etc.) are key.*
    *   **Homeworld Map Maker's Guide / Primers:**
        *   Available from [HomeworldAccess.net's Map-Makers Archive download](https://www.homeworldaccess.net/infusions/downloads/downloads.php?cat_id=14&download_id=142).
    *   **Relic's Background Tool of the Geeks (BTG Editor - from initial data):** `HW1_-_BTG_background_editor.zip`. Used for creating 2D map backgrounds.
    *   **Cataclysm Random Map Generator:** Listed on HomeworldAccess.net.
*   **Scripting & Mission Editing:**
    *   Mostly manual text editing of `.MISS` files. Understanding the scripting functions is key.
    *   **Tutorials:** Old forums (RelicNews archives) and map-making primers are the best source.
*   **Color Change Tool (HW & HWC):** Listed on HomeworldAccess.net. For editing team colors/badge colors.

### C. Homeworld 2 (Original) Specific Tools

*   **Background Creation:**
    *   **HW2BGBuilder (by FeO):** Command-line tool for creating spherical backgrounds from textures. Mentioned on Simonschreibt.de. Often found in HW2 modding tool packs.
*   **Scripting (LUA):**
    *   Relic released some LUA documentation with HW2.
    *   Extensive community tutorials developed over time on sites like RelicNews.
*   **Object Editors (Ships, Weapons):**
    *   **Object Editor (OE):** A powerful (but complex) tool for editing ship stats, weapon properties, research, etc., directly from game files.
*   **FX Tool (Particle Effects):** Relic may have released or had internal tools for `.PEO` files. Community often reverse-engineered or used text editors.

### D. Homeworld Remastered Collection Tools

### E. Tutorials & Learning Resources
