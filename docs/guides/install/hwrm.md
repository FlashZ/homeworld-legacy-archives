## Getting the Game

    *   Homeworld 2 Remastered (Updated HW2 engine, new UI, graphics)

## Running on Modern Systems & Troubleshooting

*   **General Stability:** HWRM is designed for modern systems but can still have issues.
*   **Launcher Crash Fix (Original Launcher Issues):**
    *   **Fix (from initial data):** [GitHub - lone-wolf-akela/HWR_Launcher_CrashFix](https://github.com/lone-wolf-akela/HWR_Launcher_CrashFix/) - For old launcher issues with auth site 404s. The launcher has since been updated by Gearbox.
*   **Common Issues & Fixes:**
    *   **Black Screen/Crashes:** Update graphics drivers, ensure DirectX is up to date, run as administrator.
    *   **Performance:** Adjust in-game graphics settings. Some mods can heavily impact performance.
    *   **Multiplayer Desyncs:** Were prevalent early on; patches have improved this. Ensure all players have the same game version and mods.
*   **Classic Versions in HWR - Important Notes:**
    *   **HW1 Classic:** While based on v1.05, it runs through a Gearbox compatibility layer. Some subtle engine behaviors, rendering, and especially `.BIG` file format might differ from the 1999 original. This can affect compatibility with very old mods or tools expecting the exact 1999 file structure.
    *   **HW2 Classic:** Similar to HW1 Classic, adapted for modern OS.
    *   **Mod Compatibility with Classics:** Generally better for HW1 Classic mods than HWR. However, mods heavily reliant on specific engine quirks or file formats of the original 1999/2003 releases might still have issues.

## Mods & Modding (HWR specific)

*   **Platform:** Primarily [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/workshop/). GOG users can use tools to download Steam Workshop mods.
*   **Notable HWR Mods (See [ModDB HWR Mods](https://www.moddb.com/games/homeworld-remastered-collection/mods) and Steam Workshop):**
    *   **Homeworld Remastered Players Patch (Community Patch):** A significant community effort to fix bugs, improve balance, and enhance features beyond official patches. Highly recommended.
